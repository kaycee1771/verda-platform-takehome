# AI Usage Log

This file exists to make AI assistance auditable rather than performative. Entries record the contribution, the human-controlled decision, and the verification method.

## 2026-08-16 - Phase 0 architecture and governance

- **Assistant:** OpenAI Codex. This is not Claude, and the submission must not claim otherwise.
- **Requested contribution:** Extract the assignment, design a senior/staff-level execution strategy, and implement Phase 0 governance artifacts.
- **Accepted assistance:** Requirement decomposition, architecture options, ADR framing, risk and assumption registers, proof-oriented acceptance criteria, and safe discovery script design.
- **Human authority retained:** Credit redemption, credential creation, cloud access, topology approval, external account choices, and all resource mutations.
- **Verification:** Assignment text was extracted and visually checked; current technical claims were checked against primary vendor documentation; repository validation is automated by `scripts/phase0/validate.ps1`.
- **Rejected behavior:** No attempt was made to fabricate cloud evidence, claim use of Claude, install unapproved infrastructure, or treat installed components as proof of operability.

Future entries must identify generated code that was materially changed after testing and any AI suggestion rejected because it conflicted with observed platform behavior.
